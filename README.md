# PA8

CSC2301 Programming Assignment 8

1. In this exercise you are going to modify some floating point code to compute the area and circumference of a circle.  You are provided with code in pa8-1.s that sets up to floating point variables in memory, pi and radius, that contain an approximation of pi and a variale for the radius of the circle.  The code, currently prints out those values but should be modified to print out the circumference and area of the circle.  You should set the radius to 5.0.  This should require very few lines of code, but you'll have to make sure you use the floating point registers appropriately.  Don't remember the formulae for area and circumference?  **Look them up!** :)

When your program is working correctly you should get this result:


## Grading Rubric

### Comments
Your code must contain (in comments)
 * Name of author (or both partners for pair assignments)
 * Name of assignment
 * Date assignment is completed
 * A short (one or two line) description of what your program does.
 * A description of how each register in the program is being used
 * When subroutines are created, a description of all inputs and the purpose of the function
 * Any outside resources (other than textbook, or slides) utilized in the completion of the project
 * __Each line of new code you write should indicate what that line of code is doing.__

### Grading standard

| Standard | Correctness | Design and Efficiency | Comments and format |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
|Full credit|Program fully implements the operational requirements as set forth in the assignment.  For all test inputs, the program produces the correct result.: 20 points | Code implements the algorithm in the most efficient manner possible: 5 points | Code contains all the  comments listed above: 5 points |
| Good | Program produces the correct result in 75% of the test cases: 15 points | Code does two or three operations that are not needed, or could be simplified: 3 points | 1 or 2 items missing or code not neat: 3 points |
| Fair | Program produces the correct result in 50% of the test cases: 10 points | Code does many inefficient operations, but is generally able to be followed:  2 points | about half of comments are missing: 2 points |
| Poor | Program produces the correct result in less than 50% of the test cases, but a reasonable attempt has been made to write correct code: 5 points | | Minimal commenting: 1 point |
| Nothing | Code not turned in or does not appear to address the operational requirements in any meaningful way: 0 | Code is very inefficient or convoluted or difficult to follow: 0 | No commenting: 0 |
